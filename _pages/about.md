I work with the applications of magnetic levitation and rotordynamics.

My recent work at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} focused on a systematic design framework and the manufacturing of an active magnetic bearing (AMB) spindle for micro-milling. I also performed multidisciplinary optimization that coupled AMB and motor performance.

Previously, I worked in Vibration Dynamics and Controls Laboratory at GIK Institute where I developed and benchmarked an open-source rotordynamic code [VibronRotor](https://github.com/Kazi-Sher/VibronRotor). I also worked on the design of a micro-hydro turbine and a rotor test rig.

I am passionate about the applications of magnetic levitation and the development of open-source computational and design codes.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
