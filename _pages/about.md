I work with the applications of magnetic levitation and rotordynamics.

My recent work at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} focused on a systematic design framework and the manufacturing of an active magnetic bearing (AMB) spindle for micro-milling. I also performed multidisciplinary optimization that coupled AMB and motor performance.

Previously, I worked in Vibration Dynamics and Controls Laboratory at GIK Institute where I developed and benchmarked an open-source rotordynamic code [VibronRotor](https://github.com/Kazi-Sher/VibronRotor){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I also worked on the design of a micro-hydro turbine and a rotor test rig.

I am passionate about the applications of magnetic levitation and the development of open-source computational and design codes.
